# Housing_Price_Chloropleth

The objective of this project was to visualize percent change in average real estate prices on nation wide and state wide chloropleth maps from 2010 to 2019. Precent change was measured on a year to year basis as well as total precent change accrued during the decade from a base line year (2010). Presenting the data in this way would allow an intuitive view of real asset growth in the United States, with the option of "zooming in" to the state level to see which counties drove those price changes.

Two separate datasets were needed to accomplish the descriptive analysis. The first was a list of housing prices with accompanying state, county and monthly pricing information, which was downloaded from Zillow. The second was a list of yearly population estimates on both the state and county level, which was procured from the US Census website. 

Using a combination of pandas, base python, and numpy, census data was cleaned such that each row contained a single observation (a population for a given state/county/year). Using the state population estimate for a given year, the proportion of the state's population, for a given county, for a given year, was measured. The Zillow data was cleaned and grouped such that each row contained a single observation (an average price for a given state/county/year). 

Using the state, county, and year as a key, the datasets were joined. Using the state population proportion, each county's price was weighted to represent the relative number of people affected by that price. This weighted price was summed by state to get the weighted average price of real estate for a state in a given year. Using this weighted price the percent change in price was calculated from year to year, and cumulative precent change from the 2010 price.

For the county level data, each observation was already grouped with the merged datasets. Additionally, since the objective was to get the precent price change within a county, precent change on the county level was calculated with the average price, not the price weighted by the state population. The precent change was calculated between the average real estate prices for counties from year to year. Due to issues with how the data was grouped, or lack thereof, only the total cumulative precent change from 2010 was calculated, not the accumulation of the percent change in the interceding years from 2011-2018.

Additional datasets were required to take the aggregated information and display it in chloropleth maps.

One potential avenue for more precise analysis could be to alter how the statewide population prices were weighted. The prices in this study are weighted by the proportion of the state populations, but another aspect real estate pricing relates to how populous a state is compared to the country as a whole. A certain county could be weighted heavily based on the proportion of state population that lives there, but could be in a relatively less populated state, distorting the relevancy of that price with a larger proportion of a smaller number of people than a more populous state.
